I've recently learned a bit about a mind-blowing but ancient tool: the humble
Japanese carpenter's square. This amazing device has evolved over centuries to
permit an incredible number of complex measurements.

Unfortunately, it will take more words to describe than really fit in a series of
blog posts. All of the content from this series (and more) will eventually be
moved to the "articles" section of this site.

For centuries, every joint, rafter, pillar, and beam in Japanese construction has been marked
out primarily with three extremely modest tools:

- A Japanese carpenter's square called a _sashigane_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="さしがね"
  romaji="sashigane">指矩</Kanji>).

- An inkpot and silk line called a _sumitsubo_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="すみつぼ"
  romaji="sumitsubo">墨壺</Kanji>). This ink pot is also used with a piece of
  bamboo called a _sumisashi_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="すみさし"
  romaji="sumisashi">墨差し</Kanji>) as a marking pen. Western carpenters use chalk
  lines, but Japanese carpenters use ink! These ink pots were typically
  hand-carved by each artisan and [can be quite beautiful](https://www.google.com/search?q=sumitsubo&tbm=isch).

- A length of [_mizuito_](https://suikoushya.com/ja/2020/04/15/mizuito/) cord (<Kanji client:load furigana="みずいと" romaji="mizuito">水
  糸</Kanji>) to mark horizontal and vertical references. These kanji characters,
  by the way, mean "water string".

  A horizontal layout line is called _rokuzumi_ in Japanese
  (<Kanji client:load furigana="ろくずみ" romaji="rokuzumi">陸墨</Kanji>) which means
  "land/shore ink" (basically meaning the horizon line). A vertical line is
  called _tatemizu_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="たてみず"
  romaji="tatemizu">立て水</Kanji>) or "standing/vertical water".

  I don't know for certain, but I strongly suspect that carpenters in ancient
  Japan used water with stretched _mizuito_ cords to mark out true
  horizontal and vertical references at the job site. I suspect they used [water
  levels](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_level_(device)>) to find
  horizontal, and carefully dropped droplets of water or ink to find vertical. They
  then stretched _mizuito_ cords between the two points to mark the
  horizontal/vertical lines.

These simple tools were used not just for modest homes and simple furniture, but
also for astonishingly beautiful and complex temples and castles.

Look at this photo of Himeji castle. Consider that the original was built in
the 1300's, long before calculators, laser levels and the like. Just look at
those arches and rafters! Incredibly, the layout was performed almost entirely
with a sashigane (with little or no hand calculation!).

Subsequent posts will describe more about how such a simple tool can perform so
many layout taks.
