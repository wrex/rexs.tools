I've recently learned a bit about a mind-blowing but ancient tool: the humble
Japanese carpenter's square. This amazing device has evolved over centuries to
permit an incredible number of complex measurements.

Unfortunately, it will take more words to describe than will fit in a single
blog post. Everything that follows (and more) will eventually be moved to the "articles"
section of this site.

For centuries, every joint, rafter, pillar, and beam in Japanese construction has been marked
out primarily with three extremely modest tools:

- A Japanese carpenter's square called a _sashigane_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="さしがね"
  romaji="sashigane">指矩</Kanji>).

- An inkpot and silk line called a _sumitsubo_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="すみつぼ"
  romaji="sumitsubo">墨壺</Kanji>). This ink pot is also used with a piece of
  bamboo called a _sumisashi_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="すみさし"
  romaji="sumisashi">墨差し</Kanji>) as a marking pen. Western carpenters use chalk
  lines, but Japanese carpenters use ink! These ink pots were typically
  hand-carved by each artisan and [can be quite beautiful](https://www.google.com/search?q=sumitsubo&tbm=isch).

- A length of [_mizuito_](https://suikoushya.com/ja/2020/04/15/mizuito/) cord (<Kanji client:load furigana="みずいと" romaji="mizuito">水
  糸</Kanji>) to mark horizontal and vertical references. These kanji characters,
  by the way, mean "water string".

  A horizontal layout line is called _rokuzumi_ in Japanese
  (<Kanji client:load furigana="ろくずみ" romaji="rokuzumi">陸墨</Kanji>) which means
  "land/shore ink" (basically meaning the horizon line). A vertical line is
  called _tatemizu_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="たてみず"
  romaji="tatemizu">立て水</Kanji>) or "standing/vertical water".

  I don't know for certain, but I strongly suspect that carpenters in ancient
  Japan used water with stretched _mizuito_ cords to mark out true
  horizontal and vertical references at the job site. I suspect they used [water
  levels](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_level_(device)>) to find
  horizontal, and carefully dropped droplets of water or ink to find vertical. They
  then stretched _mizuito_ cords between the two points to mark the
  horizontal/vertical lines.

These simple tools were used not just for modest homes and simple furniture, but
also for astonishingly beautiful and complex temples and castles.

Look at this photo of Himeji castle. Consider that the original was built in
the 1300's, long before calculators, laser levels and the like. Just look at
those arches and rafters! Incredibly, the layout was performed almost entirely
with a sashigane (with little or no hand calculation!).

## Traditional measurement units

Measurement units are a tricky subject, especially when talking about techniques
that span centuries and artisans separated by great distances. Don't take
anything I write here as authoritative or historically accurate in any way.

To keep things simple, I've only described the most common traditional
measurements, but I know for certain that these traditional units varied over
time as well as between the eastern and western parts of the country. As the old
saw states, that's the great thing about standards: there are so many to choose
from!

For building construction, the most important traditional linear units are:

- The _shaku_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="しゃく" romaji="shaku">尺</Kanji>).
  This unit is still used by Japanese carpenters today, but it's becoming less
  common (sort of like an Englishman referring to his weight in "stone"). The cool thing
  is that １尺 is almost _exactly_ one foot (303mm vs. the 304.8mm in a foot).
  My understanding is that the length was based on the length of a man's forearm (the span
  from wrist to elbow).

- ６尺 makes one _ken_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="けん" romaji="ken">間</Kanji>) or
  the length of a sleeping human body (with some room to spare — especially in ancient
  Japan!). This is also the standard length of a tatami mat (with regional variations).

- １尺 is comprised of 10 _sun_ (pronounced "soon", <Kanji client:load
  furigana="すん" romaji="sun">寸</Kanji>). I find it interesting that western carpenters divided a
  foot into 12 equal pieces to make fractional divisions easier (it's
  trivial to divide 12 into 2, 3, 4, or 6 equal pieces) while Japanese carpenters
  went decimal. You can think of a _sun_ as a long inch (30.3mm vs. 25.4mm).

- Similarly, １寸 comprises 10 _bu_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="ぶ"
  romaji="bu">分</Kanji>) each of which is 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a _shaku_.

As far as areal units go, there are only two of importance. Both are still used
regularly in Japan (as anyone who has rented an apartment can attest).

- A single tatami mat is ３尺 x ６尺, which is an areal unit called a _jou_ (<Kanji
  client:load furigana="じょう" romaji="jou ">畳</Kanji>).

- Two tatami mats side by side, or six square shaku, is an areal unit called a
  _tsubo_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="つぼ" romaji="tsubo">坪</Kanji>).

## Physical design

A sashigane is constructed as a single piece of forged metal, but measurements
are made with five different parts:

1. The long arm or _nagate_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="ながて"
   romaji="nagate">長手</Kanji>). The _nagate_ is typically around １尺５寸
   (454.5mm or about 1 1/2 feet long).

2. The short arm or _tsumate_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="つまて"
   romaji="tsumate">妻手</Kanji>, which means "wife's hand"). The _tsumate_ is typically
   ７寸 long (212.1mm or a little more than 8").

3. The _kanete_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="かねて" romaji="kanete">矩手</Kanji>),
   the actual right-angle in the corner to check for square.

4. The _men_ or faces (<Kanji client:load furigana="めん" romaji="men">面</Kanji>)
   with the ruled graduations. Note that the top and bottom faces are marked
   differently (and sometimes the inside and outside edges are also marked with
   different units).

5. The _sawa_ or width of an arm (<Kanji client:load furigana="さわ"
   romaji="sawa">沢</Kanji>). The width of an arm is also used for
   measuring and spacing. Each arm is exactly 5 分 wide. The kanji character
   means "valley" or "mountain stream" and refers to the hollow on each side
   (see diagram below).

The _sashigane_ has several design characteristics that aren't immediately
obvious.

First is that it's _intentionally flexible_. It's normally held with the long
arm held in the left hand, far from the short arm:

import sashiHold from "../../images/sashigane-holding.png";

<figure>
  <Image src={sashiHold} alt="Holding the sashigane" />
  <figcaption>Holding the sashigane</figcaption>
</figure>

Bending the long arm this way makes it easy to register along the edge of a
board you are marking. Note that you want to grab the end of the long arm to
give as much registration surface as possible for accuracy (and to make the
bending easy).

Each arm is exactly ５分 or very nearly 15mm wide (a little more than 1/2"). The
cross section is intentionally designed to raise the edges above the surface
of the material being measured. This gap above the surface prevents the ink from
smearing when striking a line:

import sashiCross from "../../images/sashigane-cross-section.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={sashiCross} format="avif" alt="Sashigane cross-ection" />
  <figcaption>Sashigane cross-section</figcaption>
</figure>

Even the little hollow (marked 「えぐり」 in the diagram) is cleverly
designed: in addition to providing a comfortable spot for your thumb and fingers
to grasp the tool, you can feel when the two edges along the sides of the
arc register flat on the surface (line contact provides better tactile feedback than area
contact would).

## _Hyoume_ and _Urame_ (IMPORTANT!)

Here's where the magic happens.

The top side and the bottom side of the _sashigane_ have different scales.

The "top" (<Kanji client:load furigana="おもて" romaji="omote">表</Kanji>) of the
_sashigane_ faces up when you hold the long arm in your left hand, with the short arm on
the right and pointing downward.

The "bottom" (<Kanji client:load furigana="うら" romaji="ura">裏</Kanji>) is
the opposite side (flipping either the long or short arm to point in the other
direction exposes the bottom side).

As shown in the diagram below, the top graduations are called the _hyoume_
(<Kanji client:load furigana="ひょうめ" romaji="hyoume">表目</Kanji>) and are
standard length _shaku_ and _sun_ graduations.

The bottom side graduations or _urame_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="うらめ"
romaji="urame">裏目</Kanji>), however, are 1.414 times longer (the top side
units multiplied by the square root of two).

[Terminology isn't consistent
even in Japan. Some carpenters call these bottom-side units _kakume_ (<Kanji
client:load furigana="かくめ" romaji="kakume">角目</Kanji>) instead of _urame_
(or "angle units" instead of "bottom units").]

import sashiGrads from "../../images/sashigane-graduations.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={sashiGrads} format="avif" alt="Sashigane graduations" />
  <figcaption>Sashigane graduations</figcaption>
</figure>

You probably remember the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles from high
school:

> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

Where c is the hypotenuse.

Well, if a and b are the same length, then this simplifies to

> a<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

or

> 2 &times; a<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

Take the square root of both sides, and you end up with:

> c = &radic;2 &times; a

What this means in practice is that one function of a _sashigane_ is to
automatically find right angles:

Say you have a board with parallel edges. If you wanted to cut the end off at
90°, it would be trivial: you'd just hold the long arm of the _sashigane_ along one edge
and strike a line along the short arm. Then cut along that line.

But if you wanted to strike a line at 45° it would be almost as easy:

1. Use the top side of the _sashigane_ to measure the width of the board. Let's
   say it measures ５寸.

2. Turn the _sashigane_ over, and angle it until exactly there are exactly 5
   _urame_ divisions between the two edges of the board.

3. Strike your line (which is guaranteed to be at exactly 45°).

## Slopes, not angles

It turns out that Japanse carpenters almost never use angles or talk about
"degrees", though. All angles are considered as _slopes_ (rise over run)
called _koubai_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="こうばい" romaji="koubai">勾配</Kanji>).

By convention, the run is usually considered to be 10 _sun_, and the rise expresses
the slope. Since a 45° slope has the same rise as the run, a 45° slope is
referred to as "10 _koubai_" or "10 _sun_ _koubai_".

The three sides of a right triangle are named as follows:

- The run is called the _ko_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="こ" romaji="ko">殳</Kanji>).

- The rise is called the _kou_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="こう" romaji="kou">
  勾</Kanji>).

  It's unfortunate that these two words sound so similar to western ears, but
  _kou_ sounds completely different from _ko_ to Japanese natives.

  Enunciating slowly and distinctly, _kou_ would be prounounced "ko ooh", with
  two distinct beats. _Kou_ when spoken makes a long "o" sound (kind of like the
  word "boat" but expressly drawn out for two beats: "bo-oat") while _ko_ sounds for
  just one beat and is clipped short.

- The hypotenuse is called the _gen_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="げん"
  romaji="gen">玄</Kanji>).

import kouKoGen from "../../images/koukogen.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={kouKoGen} format="avif" alt="Right triangle parts" />
  <figcaption>Right triangle parts</figcaption>
</figure>

A carpenter might say that the slope of a particular roof was "4 _sun_
_koubai_", for example, or a slope of 4/10 (equivalent to 21.8°).

## Common uses

There are countless uses for a _sashigane_, but this section lists a few of the
more common ones.

### 1. Timbers from logs

One of the simplest uses of a _sashigane_ is to determine the largest square sided
timber you can extract from a round log. Simply use the _urame_ graduations to
measure the diameter of the log. That measurement is the "real" _sun_ measurement
(_hyoume_) of each side:

import timberLog from "../../images/timber-from-log.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={timberLog} format="avif" alt="Timber from log" />
  <figcaption>Timber from log</figcaption>
</figure>

### 2. Octagons from square Timbers

Another common usage is going the other way: turning a square timber into a
somewhat round octagon shape. It's easy to draw a perfect octagon on the end of
the log.

First measure the width of one side (using the top graduations
or _hyoume_). Call this measurement `A`.

Now turn over the _sashigane_, and make a mark `A/2` in from each side using the bottom
graduations (_urame_):

import Octagon from "../../images/octagon-layout.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={Octagon} format="avif" alt="Octagon layout" />
  <figcaption>Octagon layout</figcaption>
</figure>

(Why this works is left as an exercise for the reader!)

### 3. Measuring circumferences

The inside edge of the _tsumate_ on the underside is often marked with _marume_
(<Kanji client:load furigana="まるめ" romaji="marume">丸目</Kanji>) graduations.
Each graduation is 1/&pi; &times; the length of the _hyoume_ graduations:

import Marume from "../../images/marume.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={Marume} format="avif" alt="Marume graduations" />
  <figcaption>Marume graduations</figcaption>
</figure>

Since the circumference of a circle is just &pi; times the diameter, measuring
the diameter using _marume_ graduations gives you the circumference directly (it's
much easier to measure the diameter of a circle with a ruler than it is to
measure the circumference!).

### 4. Sill-plate or threshold layout

Another illustrative use for the _sashigane_ is to layout a sill-plate to fit
precisely between two oddly shaped columns or pillars. The diagram below illustrates the
process for a made up example.

The diagram illustrates a plan perspective (a top view, looking at the ends of
the columns from above). It shows the raw stock for the sill butted
agains the vertical pillars at the top. At the bottom is the completed sill-plate after
cutting. The middle section shows the markup stock before cutting.

import Sill from "../../images/sill-plate.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={Sill} format="avif" alt="Laying out a sill-plate" />
  <figcaption>Laying out a sill plate</figcaption>
</figure>

First, butt the raw stock for the sill against the two columns. This is shown at
the top of the diagram.

1. Determine the most interior point on the right edge. This is marked 1 on
   the right side of the top diagram. For illustration, the _sashigane_ is
   shown in miniature form. In practice, the long arm of the _sashigane_ should be
   long enough for one arm to butt against the point on the right column. Strike
   a line all the way across the stock.

2. Place the _sashigane_ against the angled face, and strike two lines, one along each
   arm of the _sashigane_.

3. Plase the _sashigane_ agains the remaining angle on the right pillar, and
   strike two more orthogonal lines.

4. Now, repeat the process for the left pillar. First identify and mark the most interior
   point. In this case, the face is already orthogonal to the sill stock so only
   one line needs to be struck.

5. Place the _sashigane_ against the lower angle of the left pillar, and strike
   two orthogonal lines on the raw stock.

6. Similarly, transfer the remaining angle to the raw stock.

These six steps are shown in the top part of the diagram. Notice that there are
two orthogonal lines created for every angle that was transferred. For
measurements 1 and 4, we used the side of the stock as one of the lines since
those measurements were square to the stock. We drew them explicitly for the
non-orthogonal angles.

Note that we can strike lines parallel to any of these marks simply by sliding the
_sashigane_ along the orthogonal line.

We use this to layout the cuts as shown in the middle part of the diagram:

- First slide the _sashigane_ along the line marked 2 in the top diagram until the
  other arm intersects line 1. The point where they intersect marks the
  most interior point. Strike a line from that point all the way to the bottom
  of the stock.

- Next, slide the _sashigane_ along the baseline marked 3 in the top diagram until
  the other arm again intersects the most interior point. Strike a line to mark
  the bit that needs to poke outward.

- Repeat for the left side. First, strike a line at 4 to mark the interior face.

- Next, slide the _sashigane_ along the baseline of 5 until the other arm
  intersects line 4 near the bottom of the stock. Strike a line to mark the
  portion that protrudes.

- Finally, slide the _sashigane_ along the baseline of 6 to mark out the
  protruding point at the top left.

After cutting along the layout lines, you'll be left with the shape shown at the
bottom of the diagram, with the correct shape and length to fit precisely
between the two pillars.

The process is much easier to do than it is to describe. It just takes a bit of
practice to learn to visualize the shape you are trying to create. Just remember
that you create parallel lines by sliding the _sashigane_ along one of the
existing orthogonal lines until you reach the desired point for the parallel line.

In tight quarters, it's often easier to tape a piece of paper down and do your
layout on that (later transfering those marks to the raw stock somewhere else).

This is a very handy technique for many different situations, and will be
familiar to many different tradesmen (not just carpenters, but tile layers,
stone masons, etc.).

## Traditional vs ツウバイ ("two by") construction

In the old days, raw material was "cheap" if you valued the time and effort to
obtain it at zero. Oddly shaped trees and logs were everywhere, and "only" (!!) cost you
the time and effort to cut and transport them.

Work and experienced, skilled workers were also cheap (or at least omnipresent,
so they weren't of particular concern).

On the other hand, high quality, flat, straight, and stable material was almost
impossibly expensive to obtain (and making your own required far more effort
than merely cutting down and hauling).

Modern 2&times;4 construction has somewhat turned this on its head. Relatively
straight, kiln dried, surfaced-four-sides lumber can be acquired and even
dropped off on your doorstep at shockingly low cost (relatively speaking).
Knowledgeable and competent carpenters and other tradesmen, on the other hand,
are increasingly scarce and expensive.

Because the workers are so expensive, we think nothing of spending huge sums of
money on tools and machines that let them work more quickly. The ancients had to
make do with much more modest tooling (but accomplished high-quality work
amazingly quickly nonetheless).

Modern construction practices take advantage of the "flat and straight" nature
of our materials. It's common practice to preserve the "factory edge" of a piece
of plywood, for example, to ensure things remain square and true as they are
constructed.

Ancient craftsman, though, had to depend on their tools to keep things straight
and true. They depended on physical and mathematical principles to ensure their
creations were true and square, even if their materials weren't.

They knew for certain that a silk cord stretched between two points created a
straight line. They also knew that water seeks it's own level, that a weight
hung from a cord creates a true vertical, and that a triangle with sides 3
units, 4 units, and 5 units long creates a right triangle.

The most important layout tools in their arsenal were the three mentioned at the
beginning of this post: the _sashigane_, the _sumitsubo_ (inkpot and line), and the
_mizuito_ (water line).

The most complex of these -- by far -- was the _sashigane_. This was doubtless a
highly prized posession, and it became the reference for virtually everythihg
they built. They learned techniques to verify and, if necessary, adjust the
squareness of this reference (a subject for another blog post).

Traditional Japanese layout generally depends on idealized horizontal and
vertical lines. They knew their material was rarely constant width or straight,
so they would strike an ink line down the "center" of each face on their
material.

That inked line would represent the ideal (if imaginary) line corresponding to
a line on their drawing.

In other words, traditional Japanese layout mostly looks like stick figures. The
widths of boards are mostly ignored (as are arcs and bows). A board might be so
crooked that the ink like down the "center" might only make a mark for a short
distance at each end, missing the middle of the board entirely!

For hobbyists like myself, the traditional techniques are particularly
valuable. My time isn't costly: I _enjoy_ doing this work. Traditional
techniques allow me to use material that a pro wouldn't begin to consider.

What was old is new again.

## Going further

I've only just scratched the surface of what a _sashigane_ can do. As mentioned
in the beginning, even the astonishingly complex joints and compound angles
required to make a temple or castle can be drawn using nothing more than the
humble sashigane.

If you can draw it, and you can cut to a line, you can make the joint.

This study of layout and measurement is called _kikujutsu_ (<Kanji client:load
furigana="きくじゅつ" romaji="kikujutsu">規矩術</Kanji>) in Japanese. I'll be
devoting much of this blog to the subject as I continue my own studies.

I've two specfic projects in mind to document the process in forthcoming
sections.

The first is a sort of scoop or tray with four splayed sides. Believe it or not,
all of the compound angles required can be easily drawn using nothing more than
a _sashigane_:

import Tray from "../../images/splayed-tray.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={Tray} format="avif" alt="Splay-sided tray" />
  <figcaption>Splay-sided tray</figcaption>
</figure>

Next I plan to construct a simple splay-legged stool:

import Stool from "../../images/splayed-stool.jpeg";

<figure>
  <Image src={Stool} format="avif" alt="Splay-legged stool" />
