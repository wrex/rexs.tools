My wife came to me a few days ago asking if I could repair the cupholder in her
car.

The cupholder is a two piece assembly. The top piece is spring loaded and hinges
on two little nubs on the sides. Here's a view of the assembly with the original
parts:

The nub on one end was broken. Here's a view of
the original injection-molded part:

<div class="grid">
  <Img src="/src/images/cupholder-original.jpeg" alt="Original cupholder" />
  <Img src="/src/images/cupholder-broken.jpeg" alt="View of broken end" />
</div>

A normal person would have just drilled a hole in the end and inserted a little
pin to act as a hinge.

Instead, I designed [a whole new part in fusion 360](https://a360.co/3VNdqAe).
That link should take you to a viewer for the 3D model, but here's a static
image:

Notes:

- The nubs create "overhangs" where the 3D printer would need to print over
  empty air (causing droops and ugliness). To work around the problem I added
  some integral supports. After printing, I just broke off those supports with
  my fingers and cleaned it up a bit with a file.

- The spring is held in place between two little nubs between the center ribs.
  Rather than dealing with supports, I just printed a complete cylinder that
  goes all the way from one rib to the other. After printing, I just took a pair
  of nippers and cut out most of the center portion so I could put the spring in
  place.

Here's a short video of the final results:
