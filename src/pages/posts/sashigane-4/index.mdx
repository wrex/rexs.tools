This is part four (and possibly the most important!) in a series of posts:

- [Sashigane 1: Introduction](/posts/sashigane-1)
- [Sashigane 2: Traditional Units](/posts/sashigane-2)
- [Sashigane 3: Physical design](/posts/sashigane-3)
- Sashigane 4: _Hyoume_ and _Urame_ (this post)
- [Sashigane 5: _Kou,_ _ko,_ _gen_](/posts/sashigane-5)
- [Sashigane 6: Simple usage](/posts/sashigane-6)

## _Hyoume_ and _Urame_

Here's where the magic happens.

The top side and the bottom side of the _sashigane_ have different scales.

The "top" (<Kanji client:load furigana="おもて" romaji="omote">表</Kanji>) of the
_sashigane_ faces up when you hold the long arm in your left hand, with the short arm on
the right and pointing downward.

The "bottom" (<Kanji client:load furigana="うら" romaji="ura">裏</Kanji>) is
the opposite side (flipping either the long or short arm to point in the other
direction exposes the bottom side).

As shown in the diagram below, the top graduations are called the _hyoume_
(<Kanji client:load furigana="ひょうめ" romaji="hyoume">表目</Kanji>) and are
standard length _shaku_ and _sun_ graduations.

The bottom side graduations or _urame_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="うらめ"
romaji="urame">裏目</Kanji>), however, are 1.414 times longer (the top side
units multiplied by the square root of two).

[Terminology isn't consistent
even in Japan. Some carpenters call these bottom-side units _kakume_ (<Kanji
client:load furigana="かくめ" romaji="kakume">角目</Kanji>) instead of _urame_
(or "angle units" instead of "bottom units").]

You probably remember the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles from high
school:

> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

Where c is the hypotenuse.

Well, if a and b are the same length, then this simplifies to

> a<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

or

> 2 &times; a<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

Take the square root of both sides, and you end up with:

> c = &radic;2 &times; a

What this means in practice is that one function of a _sashigane_ is to
automatically find 90° **and 45° angles**:

Say you have a board with parallel edges. If you wanted to cut the end off at
90°, it would be trivial: you'd just hold the long arm of the _sashigane_ along one edge
and strike a line along the short arm. Then cut along that line.

But if you wanted to strike a line at 45° it would be almost as easy:

1. Use the top side of the _sashigane_ to measure the width of the board. Let's
   say it measures ５寸.

2. Turn the _sashigane_ over, and angle it until exactly there are exactly 5
   _urame_ divisions between the two edges of the board.

3. Strike your line (which is guaranteed to be at exactly 45°).

This also allows you to check if something is truly square: Measure each side
using _hyoume_ (normal 寸) to ensure they are the same length. Then measure the
diagonals using _urame_ to ensure you get the same reading.

The next part of this series will discuss right triangles and the magic of
_kou,_ _ko,_ and _gen._
