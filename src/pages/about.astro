    <p>My name is Rex. This is my personal blog. I like making things.</p>
    <p>
      When people ask me <em>what</em> I like to make, I usually answer "sawdust"
      or "chips" depending on what tool I'm using at the time. Other valid answers
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tools</li>
      <li>Machines</li>
      <li>Parts for tools or machines</li>
      <li>
        Jigs/fixtures to <em>hold</em> tools or parts to make or repair tools or
        machines
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's a very <em>meta</em> hobby ...</p>
    <p>
      I started with woodworking shortly after getting married. My wife is
      Japanese and we lived in the Osaka area for a while, so I grew interested
      in Japanese wordworking tools <Kanji
        client:load
        furigana="だいくどうぐ"
        romaji="daikudougu"
        >(大工道具)
      </Kanji>. Embarassingly, it took me a few decades to actually learn how to <em
        >use</em
      > them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point I also started to dabble in instrument making (though I've
      only actually <em>finished</em> a couple of ukuleles, I'm still hopeful that
      I'll finish a matched pair of Weissborn lap guitars before I die.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I became interested in metalworking: machining and metrology
      in particular. I'm now a proud owner of a 1947 Montgomery Wards (Logan)
      Lathe, an offshore benchtop vertical mill, and a sixties era Gorton P1-2
      pantograph engraver. That last has become my favorite machine of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      More recently, I've become re-interested in Japanese woodworking tools and
      techniques after a friend finally taught me how to tune up my Japanese
      planes (<Kanji client:load furigana="かんな" romaji="kanna">鉋</Kanji>).
