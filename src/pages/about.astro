      I like making things. When people ask me <em>what</em> I like to make, I usually
      answer "sawdust" or "chips" depending on what tool I'm using at the time.

      I've spent a lifetime collecting various tools and machines. Sadly,
      neither my father nor my grandfather were much for tools nor building
      things, so I've inherited little. I'm fortunate enough to have many
      friends with the same inclinations, though, so I've picked up many things
      over the years.

      I started with woodworking shortly after getting married. My wife is
      Japanese and we lived in the Osaka area for a while, so I grew interested
      in Japanese wordworking tools <Kanji

      Embarassingly, it took me a few decades to actually learn how to <em
        >use</em
      > them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point I also started to dabble in instrument making (though I've
      only actually _finished_ a couple of ukuleles, I'm still hopeful that I'll
      finish a matched pair of Weissborn lap guitars before I die.)

      Eventually, I started getting interested in metalworking, machining and
      metrology in particular. I'm now a proud owner of a 1947 Montgomery Wards
      (Logan) Lathe, an offshore benchtop vertical mill, and a sixties era
      Gorton P1-2 pantograph engraver. That last has become my favorite
