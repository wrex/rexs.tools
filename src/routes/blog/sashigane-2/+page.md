## Traditional measurement units

Measurement units are a tricky subject, especially when talking about techniques
that span centuries and artisans separated by great distances. Don't take
anything I write here as authoritative or historically accurate in any way. Most
of these units originated in China originally.

To keep things simple, I've only described the most common traditional
measurements, but I know for certain that these traditional units varied over
time as well as between the eastern and western parts of the country (much less
China). As the old saw states, that's the great thing about standards: there are
so many to choose from!

The measurement system I describe is called _shakkanhou_ <Kanji client:load
furigana="しゃっかんほう" romaji="shakkanhou">(尺貫法)</Kanji>. The system came
from China originally, though the standard unit lengths doubtless changed many
times over the centuries and miles of travel.

For building construction, the most important traditional linear units are:

- The _shaku_ (&nbsp;<Kanji client:load furigana="しゃく" romaji="shaku">尺</Kanji>&nbsp;).
  This unit is still used by Japanese carpenters today, but it's becoming less
  common (sort of like an Englishman referring to his weight in "stone"). The cool thing
  is that １尺 is almost _exactly_ one foot (303mm vs. the 304.8mm in a foot).
  My understanding is that the length was based on the length of a man's forearm (the span
  from wrist to elbow).

- ６尺 makes one _ken_ (&nbsp;<Kanji client:load furigana="けん" romaji="ken">間</Kanji>&nbsp;)
  or the length of a sleeping human body (with some room to spare — especially in
  ancient Japan!). This is also pretty close to the standard length of a tatami
  mat.

  (To be pedantic, there are two "standard" sizes of tatami mats: the eastern
  region uses <Kanji client:load furigana="いなかま" romaji="inakama">田舎間 </Kanji>
  mats that are roughly 176 cm &times 88 cm, while the western region
  uses <Kanji client:load furigana="きょうま" romaji="kyouma">京間</Kanji> mats that are
  roughly 190 cm &times 95 cm. Both differ from 6 尺&times;3 尺 which is
  181.8 cm &times; 90.9 cm.)

- １尺 is comprised of 10 _sun_ (pronounced "soon", <Kanji client:load
  furigana="すん" romaji="sun">寸</Kanji>&nbsp;). I find it interesting that western carpenters divided a
  foot into 12 equal pieces to make fractional divisions easier (it's
  trivial to divide 12 into 2, 3, 4, or 6 equal pieces) while Japanese carpenters
  went decimal. You can think of a _sun_ as a long inch (30.3mm vs. 25.4mm).

- Similarly, １寸 comprises 10 _bu_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="ぶ"
  romaji="bu">分</Kanji>) each of which is 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a _shaku_.

- Finally, the smallest unit is a _rin_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="りん" 
  romaji="rin">厘</Kanji>) which is 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a _bu_, or
  1/1000<sup>th</sup> of a _shaku_.

As far as areal units go, there are only two of importance. Both are still used
regularly in Japan (as anyone who has rented an apartment can attest).

- A single tatami mat is ３尺 x ６尺, which is an areal unit called a _jou_ (<Kanji
  client:load furigana="じょう" romaji="jou ">畳</Kanji>).

- Two tatami mats side by side, or six square shaku, is an areal unit called a
  _tsubo_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="つぼ" romaji="tsubo">坪</Kanji>).

## These aren't the units you are looking for

Today, _sashigane_ can be purchased with either traditional _shaku_ based units
(<Kanji client:load furigana="しゃっくかんほう" romaji="shakkanhou">尺貫法</Kanji>)
or metric units, but many have the same units on both sides of the
square (sadly) -- you must ask specially for _sashigane_ with _urame_ or
_kakume_ scales on the bottom side (to be explained in subsequent articles).

While 尺貫法 _sashigane_ can be easily acquired in Japan ([_Shinwa
Sokutei_](https://www.shinwasokutei.co.jp/) is one major manufacturer) the
system was apparently outlawed during or shortly after the Meiji Restoration. As
is their wont, the progressive politicians of the time passed a law (circa 1868)
that only metric based units were permitted going forward.

To this day, _shaku_ and _sun_ based measuring tools always have this mysterious
mark at various locations: "/33m":

<Figure src={NotSun} caption="Mysterious '/33m' marks" />

For the longest time, the author had no idea what those marks meant. They are there to
work around the law mandating metric units! 1/33 = 0.0303. So 1/33<sup>rd</sup>
of a meter is 0.0303m or 30.3mm, which just happens to be the length of one
_sun_.

> "These are not the old, illegal, _sun_ based measurements you were looking
> for, Mr. Inspector-san, sir: these are 1/33 meter units!"

The remainder of the series will only discuss _shaku_ based _sashigane_, where
１尺 is exactly 303mm (as most modern _sashigane_ are marked) but at least be
aware that there are regional and historical variations in the absolute lengths.
The principles remain the same regardless.
