## Traditional measurement units

Measurement units are a tricky subject, especially when talking about techniques
that span centuries and artisans separated by great distances. Don't take
anything I write here as authoritative or historically accurate in any way. Most
of these units originated in China originally.

To keep things simple, I've only described the most common traditional
measurements, but I know for certain that these traditional units varied over
time as well as between the eastern and western parts of the country (much less
China). As the old saw states, that's the great thing about standards: there are
so many to choose from!

For building construction, the most important traditional linear units are:

- The _shaku_ (&nbsp;<Kanji client:load furigana="しゃく" romaji="shaku">尺</Kanji>&nbsp;).
  This unit is still used by Japanese carpenters today, but it's becoming less
  common (sort of like an Englishman referring to his weight in "stone"). The cool thing
  is that １尺 is almost _exactly_ one foot (303mm vs. the 304.8mm in a foot).
  My understanding is that the length was based on the length of a man's forearm (the span
  from wrist to elbow).

- ６尺 makes one _ken_ (&nbsp;<Kanji client:load furigana="けん" romaji="ken">間</Kanji>&nbsp;)
  or the length of a sleeping human body (with some room to spare — especially in
  ancient Japan!). This is also the standard length of a tatami mat (with regional
  variations).

- １尺 is comprised of 10 _sun_ (pronounced "soon", <Kanji client:load
  furigana="すん" romaji="sun">寸</Kanji>&nbsp;). I find it interesting that western carpenters divided a
  foot into 12 equal pieces to make fractional divisions easier (it's
  trivial to divide 12 into 2, 3, 4, or 6 equal pieces) while Japanese carpenters
  went decimal. You can think of a _sun_ as a long inch (30.3mm vs. 25.4mm).

- Similarly, １寸 comprises 10 _bu_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="ぶ"
  romaji="bu">分</Kanji>) each of which is 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a _shaku_.

- Finally, the smallest unit is a _rin_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="りん" 
  romaji="rin">厘</Kanji>) which is 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a _bu_, or
  1/1000<sup>th</sup> of a _shaku_.

As far as areal units go, there are only two of importance. Both are still used
regularly in Japan (as anyone who has rented an apartment can attest).

- A single tatami mat is ３尺 x ６尺, which is an areal unit called a _jou_ (<Kanji
  client:load furigana="じょう" romaji="jou ">畳</Kanji>).

- Two tatami mats side by side, or six square shaku, is an areal unit called a
  _tsubo_ (<Kanji client:load furigana="つぼ" romaji="tsubo">坪</Kanji>).

Today, _sashigane_ can be purchased with either traditional _shaku_ based units
(<Kanji client:load furigana="しゃっくかんほう" romaji="shakkanhou">尺貫法</Kanji>)
or metric units, and many have the same units on both sides of the
square (sadly) -- you must ask specially for _sashigane_ with _urame_ or
_kakume_ scales on the bottom side. This is the subject of the next post in the
series.

The remainder of the series will only discuss _shaku_ based _sashigane_, but
the principles are the same, regardless.
